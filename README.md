Ty Smidy - Master button Maker ðŸ˜Ž

Iâ€™ve been in the industry for about 5 years, starting at Apple in support before moving into a Support Engineer role at a startup. 
These days I spend a lot more time with code: reading it, troubleshooting, and writing when needed.

Background experience:
Past: .NET, SQL, IBM RPG, Java
Current stack: Vue, JS/TS, Node, MongoDB, Google Cloud

Most of my past coding work has lived inside company repos, so my GitHub looks sparse.
My goal now is to fill it out with personal projects that sharpen my skills and eventually build into a strong portfolio.

Current Work:
OMDB API App
Search for a movie â†’ get results from OMDB API
Mostly done, still needs CSS polish + some extra data fields
Purpose: warm-up project with my current stack

Roadmap:
Random Joke Generator (Level 1)
Button fetches a random joke from an API
Bonus: Save favorites in localStorage
Purpose: Learn async/await and basic API handling

Weather App (Level 2)
User enters a city â†’ backend fetches data from OpenWeather API
Displays temperature, description, and icon
Bonus: Save last 5 searches in MongoDB
Purpose: Tie frontend, backend, and API calls together

Recipe Finder (Level 3)
Search recipes by ingredient â†’ backend calls TheMealDB API
Display recipe name, image, instructions
Users can save favorites (MongoDB)
Bonus: Add filters (vegetarian, dessert, etc.)
Purpose: Practice API integration, JSON handling, and database use

Expense Tracker (Level 4: Portfolio Project)
Users sign up & log in (JWT)
Add expenses by category
Dashboard with charts (monthly spend, category breakdown)
Export to CSV
Bonus: Deploy to AWS (EC2/Amplify + Mongo Atlas)

Stack: Vue + Node + Mongo + Chart.js/Recharts
Skills gained: Authentication, CRUD, data visualization, cloud deployment

Resources
Chart.js
MERN on AWS
Vue + Express Guide

Closing Thoughts
Right now my focus is building a solid foundation through projects that gradually increase in complexity. This repo is where Iâ€™ll track that progress â€” from small practice apps to portfolio-ready work.
